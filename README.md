# AtariGames

Implementations of DQN agent for all atari games based on [paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf) which I did in august 2020.
There are also weights I get after 291 and 400 episodes of training on pong game (which is easiest to train), but same model can be used for other atari games.
